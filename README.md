              Application Layer (App Program: SNMP, DHCP, DNS, HTTP, LDAP, SMTP, FTP)
              -----------------
               Transport Layer (End-to-End, TCP/UDP, Stream, Seq Packets, Datagram, Channel, AppleTalk)
              -----------------
                Network Layer  (IP, ICMP, IGMP: Ping Scanning/Traceroute Exploitation, Packet Exchange, Data Delivery, Shortest Path Bridge, Carries Subnet Mask, Spec Next Hop Addr)
              -----------------
                 Link  Layer   (MAC, subnet)

OSI Model in 1994

              Presentation Layer (Data to Apps: Data Conversion, Compression, Encrpto, code, services, Remote DB Access, RPC?, Remote Ops, Reliable Transfer, Distributed Transaction)

# Presentation Layer, 表現層
# Remote Access Services (遠端連線)

* VPN, Virtual Private Network

* TELNET, Terminal Emulation Protocol

* rLogin, rsh, rcp

* Screen Scraper

* Virtual Desktop & Virtual Apps

# Session Layer, 會議層

* Tunneling (隧道)

using PPP in Layer5 is as same as PPP used in Layer 2.

* RPC, Remote Procedure Call

It allows executing obj accross hosts, with a client sending instruction to an app resided on different host in network, there are some services in this category, such as: Distributed Computing Env.

Plz note that RPC doesn't provide any service on its own, it only provides basic auth and address the target service. So it can be considered as a Broker.

# Layer 4

# Layer 3

* RADIUS, auth prototcol used in Layer 3 (single sign-on)
  
  it has some flaws such as:
  
  (1) can be attacked by Replay Attack.
  
  (2) has no Integrity Protection.
  
  (3) only transmit field using Encrpto.
  
# Link Layer


# Phisical Layer

* Endpoint (Host) Security

  (1) user may use limited access accounts in accordance with concept of "Least Previlege".

  (2) update anti-virus aand anti-malware software.
  
  (3) host-based firewall.
  
  (4) cnfg with unneeded services disabled
  
  (5) maitain ops
  
* Analog Communication

* Digital Communication

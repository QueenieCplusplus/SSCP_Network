# Presentation Layer, 表現層
# Remote Access Services (遠端連線)

* VPN, Virtual Private Network

* TELNET, Terminal Emulation Protocol

* rLogin, rsh, rcp

* Screen Scraper

* Virtual Desktop & Virtual Apps

# RPC, Remote Procedure Call

It allows executing obj accross hosts, with a client sending instruction to an app resided on different host in network, there are some services in this category, such as: Distributed Computing Env.

Plz note that RPC doesn't provide any service on its own, it only provides basic auth and address the target service. So it can be considered as a Broker.

# Session Layer, 會議層
# Tunneling (隧道)

using PPP in Layer5 is as same as PPP used in Layer 2.

# Layer 4

# Layer 3

* RADIUS, auth prototcol used in Layer 3 (single sign-on)

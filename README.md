# Layer 7 (APP)

* SNMP, Simple Network Mgmt Protocol

https://github.com/QueenieCplusplus/SNMP

it involves a server (called as Manager) and a client which is a software install in network devices such as router/sw called agent.

it allows manger to get values of variables which is set from agent. The varaibles includes Routing Table and performance info.

even SNMP is upgraded to version 2, its vulnerability still remains, which is that its password is easy to be sniffed (transmission in plaintext) in the commands process then being faked one by Middleman, when server identifies itself against an agent (community string is sent to agent) and password is sent in commend. 

# Layer 6, Presentation Layer, 表現層

* Remote Access Services, 遠端連線

  (1) VPN, Virtual Private Network
  
     a vpn is a tunnel within encrpto between 2 hosts allowing them to do secret connection in untrusted internet. There are 2 way to do this implementation:
     
     1. point-to-point connection
     
     2. gw-to-gw connection between sites or business partener
     
        in this way, the GRE, generic routing encapsultation is implemented over tunnel between endpoint(GWs).
        
        However there are still a risk remained, which is auth way that the encrpt key is derived from users password, it is easier to be attacked. So it is better to use TFA, two factors authentication instead of password-based VPN.

  (2) TELNET, Terminal Emulation Protocol
  
     it is without protection from encrpto, so it is recommend used with rLogin via SSH. see below! 
     
     Telnet is a command line protocol to give cmd access to another host, this is present in many UNIX OS, which combines with NFS and NIS.  

  (3) rLogin, rsh, rcp

  (4) Screen Scraper

  (5) Virtual Desktop & Virtual Apps

  (6) Vendor Backdoors

  (7) Vulnerabilities in OS or Firmware

# Layer 5, Session Layer, 會議層

* Tunneling, 隧道

  using PPP in Layer 5 is as same as PPP used in Layer 3.
  https://github.com/QueenieCplusplus/PPP
  
  *** PPP, P2P protocol
  
  P2P apps are often designed to open a (uncontrolled) channel thru internet. However it indeed exist some vulnerabilty inside this P2P way due to its overlapped master & slave nodes:
  
  if one node are detected and shut down, the Bot still can make one of the slave nodes as master and use the redundant staging point to do unimpeded Bot ops.
  
  (1) Botnet 
  
  (2) Spyware app
  
  (3) Virus got entrypoint

* RPC, Remote Procedure Call, 遠程呼叫

  It allows executing obj accross hosts, with a client sending instruction to an app resided on different host in network, there are some services in this category, such as: Distributed Computing Env.

  Plz note that RPC doesn't provide any service on its own, it only provides basic auth and address the target service. So it can be considered as a Broker.

# Layer 4 (Transmission)

* TCP

* UDP

# Layer 3 (Logical)

skip see ARP or ICMPv6 in https://github.com/QueenieCplusplus/QuickGoThru#ccda-cisco-certified-design-associate-網路架構師專業 

* ICMP

* IGMP

* RADIUS, auth prototcol used in Layer 3 (single sign-on)
  
  it has some flaws such as:
  
  (1) can be attacked by Replay Attack.
  
  (2) has no Integrity Protection.
  
  (3) only transmit field using Encrpto.

# Layer 1, Phisical Layer, 物理層

* Endpoint (Host) Security

  (1) user may use limited access accounts in accordance with concept of "Least Previlege".

  (2) update anti-virus aand anti-malware software.
  
  (3) host-based firewall.
  
  (4) cnfg with unneeded services disabled
  
  (5) maitain ops
  
* Analog Communication

* Digital Communication
